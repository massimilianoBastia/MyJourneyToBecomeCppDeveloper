## [C++ developers - Need guidance](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/182z5up/c_developers_need_guidance/)


The thread begins with points to discuss:

* What software do you use for Enterprise?

* What do you guys actually do with C++? like Data Science people build models, backend developers build API to connect with the frontend, Frontend developers build UI interacting with the server. (Please multiple responsibilities of your day-to-day life)

* Any Great Resource to learn and get hired as C++?

* People using C++ for trading firms please tell me a project idea along with tools which I can build and looks like 2 years experience.

They talk about how much C++ is used in applications where ***speed is needed*** and as a development environment they alternate between ***visual studio*** and ***visual studio code**.
An interesting piece of advice is where it is recommended to try to build a simple matching engine. Accept orders over a socket, store, accept amends and cancels, match them for fills. Write your own basic FIX engine, to looks like 2 years experience.
Others used editor/ide are:  ***Vim,YouCompleMe/clangd,Vimspector***
